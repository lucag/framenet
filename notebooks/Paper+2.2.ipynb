The following applies the constructor `Lit` to the strings `'Ext'`, `'Obj'`, `'Dep'`, and `'_'` (our wildcard) and assigns the result to the corresponding Python variables. This way `Ext`, `Obj`, `Dep` and `x` can be combined in the patterns below.\n",

had lost his title , and showered Benn with coins and rubbish .</li><li>Mr Sutherland , who lives in Holland , was reunited with his 27-year-old wife Anita on the tarmac -- seconds before the DC-10 exploded , showering them with debris .</li><li>It smashed the car 's sunroof showering the family with glass .</li><li>She picked her way between them , treading with care so as not to shower things with sand .</li><li>She popped a prawn ball into her mouth and bit on it , showering him with sweet and sour sauce .</li><li>Heavy fighting had scattered the desert with damaged tanks , twisted wrecks that once were jeeps and burned-out trucks stuck head-first in deep sand drifts .</li><li>Alexei leaned a little to one side so that a slave could heap his plate with k'va , the staple grain which was similar to rice .</li><li>The vandals broke into the house , piled the cooker with linen then switched it on and set light to it .</li><li>` Only teasing you , Wraysford , \" said Harrington , piling
