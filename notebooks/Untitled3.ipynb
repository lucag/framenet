full of pupils and a girl was quite badly injured .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Divorce or the death of a husband is enough to catapult a middle-class white woman and her children into poverty .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She chucks a bath towel to me .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;` Wilhelm wo n&#39;t speak to me since I chucked his Filofax in the jacuzzi .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can chuck me in the river , if you like , for all the good I am to meself .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We chucked their livers into a large barrel fastened to the mast ; these were sold for cod-liver oil and the money they fetched was the perquisite of the crew .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He chucks it into the sea .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The modern manager establishes his machismo , not by creating a business that can employ thousands , but by buying a business and then chucking all his supposedly supernumerary workers on the dole .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you just chuck it on the floor , then someone s got to come round alter you and pick it up .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In Ancient Rome they &#39;d have chucked him to the lions .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dolly chucked the pack at him .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Marie yelled after me to wait but I did n&#39;t want to talk to her about it so I chucked my sandwich-box over to her and told her she could eat them for me .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You ca n&#39;t run with a baby , and I &#39;m not going to drag my kids into the sort of life I &#39;ve been living .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then I got up and took the two rugs by their corners and dragged them outside the door .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lucenzo swept over to her , caught her arm and dragged her to the entrance of the ballroom .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He was looking pleased with himself as he dragged the table to the side of the room to make space to work in .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cornelius dragged the portmanteau towards the inn door .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With a sob , Theda flung her arms about his neck and buried her face in his shoulder .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the group then grabbed the boy and flung him against a wall .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Robbie screamed and flung herself against the protective width of Fen &#39;s chest .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kate flung her arms around him and wept for joy .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Milton flung himself in his chair and buried his head in his hands .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then , in the very same breath , she snatched up the toppled coffee-cup and flung the lukewarm contents in his face .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Barton scooped up all the bits of paper and flung them into the air .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suddenly they all surged towards me and flung their coins into the canvas sheet I was guarding and one old codger decided to go home .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He unzipped his black jacket and flung it on a chair .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The customers in return sneered at the clothing offered to them , and flung it on the ground .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He flung the helmet on the ground and Philip grabbed it .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In we would climb , rolling up hats and coats and flinging them onto the back seat .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The men flung a net over me .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She flung herself to the floor and rolled to safety behind the half-opened door , the Beretta clenched tightly in her gloved hand .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;` Oh , yer swine , &#34; breathed the young woman as he flung the handbag to the ground .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She flung the tape at him .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JUST AS THE PANTING CYCLIST drew ahead of the London to St Alban &#39;s coach the guard hurled an iron ball on a rope into the spokes of the bicycle wheel and felled the rider .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two fiesty little Yorkshire terriers leap off his lap and hurl their combined body weight of two grapefruits against my legs .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He suddenly grabbed the beer can and hurled it against the wall then upturned the table , sending it crashing against the cooker .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I followed them onto a narrow , crumbling ledge above the ravine where the wind hurled us against the wall .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Speechless with rage , Mait hurled the card in the Doctor &#39;s face before storming out of the cell .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;C&#39;zinsit hurled himself into the saddle and charged away .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;David Gower survives a caught-behind appeal off Mushtaq , provoking substitute Rashid Latif ( centre , in cap ) into a dash down the length of the pitch , where he hurled his cap to the ground .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He hurled himself at the boy .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years , and by now she ought to be totally immune to them .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Earlier this month Mr Cossiga publicly hurled the epithet ‘ son of a … ’ at a British journalist who described Italy &#39;s military contribution to the Gulf war as a ‘ token force ’ .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;` I hurled my shirt down because I was so angry -- I felt cheated .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lindsey rose to her feet , nudging a drawer to a close .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After the nest is complete and around 30cm in diameter , the male nudges the female under it and egg laying begins .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The boilerhouse bridge needed repairing before it pitched us all into the river .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The girls plan to to pitch their talents against the boys at the end of term , so they &#39;re getting as much practice as possible .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He had smiled at the frontier guards and kept walking with his rucksack slung over one shoulder … until the hand had clamped on his collar , and the boots had pitched him into a cell .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Erm I &#39;d like to pitch another figure into the debate , er because I do n&#39;t agree with the County Council on this either .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And yet , if Mr Brown does pitch his hat into the gubernatorial contest , he will start with a handicap .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you try to pitch the ball onto the top , particularly working from a tight lie , you will find it almost impossible to pull the ball up quickly enough .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instantly Harriet pressed her hand across her mouth in a theatrical gesture .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The surgeon presses his stethoscope in my hands : ` What is your opinion of this patient ? &#34; he asks .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He pressed his thumb in the hollow of one of her cheeks and circled it , rubbing it abrasively over her trembling lips .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She pressed herself into her corner of the sofa .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He pressed his face into her hair .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He knocked my gun from my hand then pushed me up against the wall , pressing his own gun into my stomach .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He pressed his face into the pillow to conceal the sound of a sobbing he could not control .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She pressed a firm finger on the bell .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She groaned , pressing her hands over her ears , but it was n&#39;t that simple to cut off the insidious little voice .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She was hardly breathing when , his lips warm and gentle , he pressed a light kiss to her cheek .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lou pressed her hands to her eyes .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The glass ball &#39;s pretty warm now and I press it to my cheek and sort of roll it against my skin .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cornelius knelt and pressed an ear to the keyhole of the closed door .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He groaned , caught her hand in his and pressed his mouth to the palm .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He pressed his brow against the coolness of the pane , and shut his eyes .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After 1970 , the operation of union membership agreements pushed overall membership consistently above 90 per cent , and for some grades such as train drivers , unionization has been virtually total .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The shoots were pushing their heads above the ground even though the group was still able to claim record profits as late as January of this year .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She pushed her chair against the table .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Staring at him in confusion , she hauled herself upright in the bed and pushed the pillow behind her .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She pushed a chair behind him and he dropped on to it , sitting forward , gripping the sideboard .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There were newspapers on a table , the story was on an open page and if Marshall had not closed the paper and pushed it beneath others , Wickham &#39;s curiosity would not have been aroused .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She pushed a cigarette between her dry lips then fumbled in her coat pocket for a lighter and , cupping her trembling fingers around the flame , lit it and inhaled deeply .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When she saw where I was sitting she pushed her hands in her coat pockets and ambled over on her shaky heels .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She must have forgotten a few things in the holidays , like the time I pushed her in the school goldfish pond .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alice crumpled it up and pushed it into the kitchen bin .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;` Are you suggesting Joseph pushed her into the water as she walked through the harbour ? &#34;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cranston pushed his face to the grille .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Somebody had pushed a note under his door .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He dropped the lot into a shoe box and pushed them under the bed .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sammy wriggled into his arms and pushed his head underneath Tom &#39;s chin .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He grabbed Farrell again and pushed his face within inches .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A EUROPEAN ruling today pushed Britain closer to being placed in the dock over the killing by SAS soldiers in Gibraltar of three IRA terrorists .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dolly pushed the cruet across .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;` Syrup , Mother ? &#34; said Jimmy , pushing the tin across .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We could shove the other one in the wreck of the old car . &#34;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then she shoved the sketch pad back into the bag .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A waitress shoved a plate of cocktail bits beneath Joshua &#39;s nose .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She reached the house , ran into the front room and shoved the suitcase behind a big , glass case that had a capercailzie in it .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She went into the bathroom and I made my own supper by slicing some of the foul cheese and shoving it between two slices of greased plastic bread .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then he shoved the letter in his jacket pocket and stood .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He shoved my shirt in my mouth first , so I would n&#39;t make a noise . &#34;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yesterday he was at Hartlepool Labour Hall , surrounded by a dozen or so women shoving leaflets into envelopes .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;` Aye , go on you , I &#39;ll shove the kettle on the fire , a cup of tea always helps things along . &#34;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So they just shove some tape over it .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did n&#39;t move back , although he shoved his face close to mine .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She hung the apron over the back of a chair , shoved the sauce under a covering plate , turned off the gas under the fish-kettle in which herb-scented water had begun to simmer .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He shoved Gorelli against the Chrysler with his gun and pulled the rear door open .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He pulled the pistol free and shoved it against Hitch &#39;s cheek .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They hit many patches of soft sand and wasted hours unloading vehicles , shoving them up to the top of dunes and reloading again .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whitlock shoved him back onto a tarpaulin in the corner of the warehouse and scooped up the Browning .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hartlepool magistrates heard that he allegedly threw a petrol bomb into the rear of the premises .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Auguste rushed to the kitchen across the corridor , returning with a bottle of water , hotly pursued by Boris , and threw it all over Fouchard .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Corbett repeated his instructions and , throwing his cloak about him , went downstairs .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We threw ourselves against the door , and as the lock broke we went in .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When John threw him against the foam sofa unit , it tipped over backward and he cracked his head against the window behind , splitting the glass .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unable to sleep and seeing Madame &#39;s bedroom light still on , she had thrown a pebble against the glass and called her down .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When it goes off you throw it against the wall to stop the noise .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She ejected the clip and threw it amongst a pile of discarded wooden crates in the corner of the shed , then buried the rifle under a mound of rubble in the pockmarked skip .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both parents got very emotional and threw their arms around her , although she had never felt they were very close before .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He pulled it off and threw it behind him , revealing himself naked to the waist .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Government &#39;s chances of forcing debate into the small hours against Labour and rebel Tory opposition were boosted when the Liberal Democrats threw their weight behind the procedural Commons motion .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What safety they offered was debatable , but if worst came to worst he would throw himself beneath a car , and deny the voiders the entertainment of his slow demise .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instinctively , she darted forward , throwing herself between them .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She had heard the cops on Plenty did n&#39;t even bother throwing you in jail .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And once he had heard Sweetheart coming down the stairs , her high-heels ringing on the stone steps , and he had thrown the stolen food in Rosie &#39;s corner in a panic .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Despite the time lost , he threw himself into his work and eventually , with a good brain and a determination to achieve , obtained qualification to become a surgeon in a children &#39;s hospital .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The boy waved his stick round his head and threw it into the pool .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On their way to the station she would not throw her coin into the Trevi Fountain .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feathers , who was not Harry &#39;s father , told the court he threw the baby on the bed because he would not stop crying .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the nature of such a vibration can be established it may throw some light on the nature of the electronic band .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And he took out the keys and threw them onto the bonnet .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flora blew her nose into the pristine handkerchief , scrunched it into a ball and threw it onto the linoleum floor .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The barman returned , smiled , and threw the liquid over his face .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And a businessman in Middlesbrough threw eight thousand pounds to masked raiders who rammed his car .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paramount have thrown caution to the wind and employed MICHAEL CIMINO to write and direct a movie entitled Heaven Is A Sometime Thing .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He ran to help and found that , instead of repairing it , men were thrusting what they could into carts , still under its netting .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He thrust the coin among his clothes and started to run away but turned back to say , ` You a Yankee , Mister ? &#34;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When Sarah was leaving , Maggie thrust a parcel in her arms .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He thrust both hands in his pockets and rocked back on his heels .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He leaned back in his chair and thrust his hands inside his trouser pockets .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It was cold and he thrust his hands deeper inside the pockets of his coat .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finally he stood up , thrusting his hands into the pockets of his black trousers .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He thrust a sandwich on a plate in front of her .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Michael impatiently thrust him on one side and brought out the sack .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But a moment later he was up again and had thrust his head over the back of the board .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sam thrust his leg over the sill .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tzann thrust the sealed orders to one side , on top of a small pile of unopened mail .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He cursed himself inwardly and tried to thrust the whole matter to the back of his mind .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A brave reporter thrust a microphone under his nose and asked him for his comments .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The whisper made him stir in his sleep , turning and thrusting one arm under the pillow .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ace tried to thrust a ghostly neural net crystal underneath the Doctor &#39;s nose and only succeeded in pushing it out of the image field .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then she thrust a foot against her husband &#39;s side , saying , ` You had your answer , did n&#39;t you ? &#34;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A white line of fury around his mouth , he lifted the gold locket around her neck and , opening it with his thumbnail , thrust it before her eyes .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;` Yes , &#34; she agreed , tossing the offending garment back on to the bed .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bliss turned on his heel and , pausing only to toss his cigarette end into one of the fire buckets , sauntered out of the hotel lobby .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paul pulled several cubes of sugar from his pocket and tossed them among the children , and they squealed and fought among themselves , passing the prizes eventually from hand to hand .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the station I pick up my other parcel from Left Luggage , and toss it in a holdall .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That way , when you bust your board , you do n&#39;t just toss it in the garbage .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ymor crumpled the note and tossed it into a corner .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Taking it out , she ripped it into tiny pieces then tossed the fragments into the bucket that still stood on the dresser like some awful avant-garde ornament .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With two brisk movements she wrenched the wire loose and tossed the microphone into the water .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He took out the letter and tossed it on the counter .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tossed the paper on the desk and looked moodily out of the window .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting out , he tossed the cap on the seat , wrestled off the uniform , exposing the lightweight dark suit he wore under it .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The man strode into the centre of the room and tossed his hat onto a chair .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Graham took an envelope from his pocket and tossed it onto the sofa .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He had tossed his coat over the back of a chair and was pouring whiskies .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He tossed the plans to one side .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He took two pears from a bowl and tossed one to Rostov .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But if I were Ben Hogan , and a Bob Hamilton or Willie Goggin chipped in to beat me in The Masters , a Walter Burkemo holed a sand shot to swipe the PGA , a raw rookie -- pick one -- holed a 7-iron to beat me somewhere in Florida and then the like of a Bud Holscher or a Shelley Mayfield holed yet another sand shot to steal yet another victory , then I &#39;d not only be scouring the Fort Worth Yellow Pages looking for the nearest shrink , I might even think of tossing myself under a freight train in the nearest marshalling yard .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He turned and tossed a penny at the lad still squatting in the corner .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ace slid to the floor and cleared a space around her by tossing dead creatures on to the pile of bodies in the middle of the cabin .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now he was content to release him , to toss him back in the water like a catch unworthy of the landing .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Holly took the bread and tugged it between his fingers and wolfed it to his mouth .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He tugged a fur-lined hat over his cropped white hair as he approached the transit van , his eyes riveted on Vasili &#39;s face .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The weight of the engine tugged his nose down and he had to keep tugging it up again .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fearon dragged it on over his sweater , tugged a disreputable flat cap over his wet hair and set off briskly towards the yard .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grabbing her by the arm , he yanked her to her feet .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;FitzAlan reached down and yanked her to her feet .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He propelled her towards the door and flung it wide dragging her out onto the landing .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cupboard doors were flying , the trash can in the kitchen walked a few feet , the dogs came running , and I scooted them into the dog run and stood in the doorway myself , watching the outside trash cans dance across the concrete .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh , they &#39;d have to move it to Taiwan for people not to know about it practically .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Democrats forced the Senate into a rare closed door session .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dai-Siu ( Big and Small ) is a dice game in which the croupier throws three dice inside a glass container .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\"\n",

he pulled Lazlo &#39;s map from his pocket and flung it across the table , ` The great detective left this behind when he and Rex fled from his office last night .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The last word was a terrible scream and as she screamed it she flung the glass in the direction of Eddie although I &#39;m pretty sure she was n&#39;t aiming at anyone in particular .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another dealer owed a few hundred pounds by the director of a firm he had just left , drove one night with some friends to his house , where they flung bricks through every window .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Balberith ripped the remains of the fruit and salad bar from its mountings and flung it through the roof .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With a final contemptuous glance she lifted the calliper by its straps and flung it over the small cliff .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the presence of a few hundred Masai , the young warrior hurled his spear right through the district officer &#39;s heart .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The gaunt woman hurled his plastic pistol after him .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At last he sat back , tousled and infuriated , crumpled the cheque and hurled it across the room .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dashwood let out a howl of frustration and hurled Farrell across the room .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He hurled a chair across the set , smashing lamps and vases , then stormed off to his dressing room .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ellen hurled the still discharging extinguisher over the side .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then , when the boy was n&#39;t looking in his direction he hurled it towards the pool .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They hurled potatoes at firemen trying to douse a bonfire of tyres in the town &#39;s central square , prompting riot police to fire tear gas .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So I nudged Martin in the direction of a mindless blonde divorcee .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He would pitch a dead tree over the front fence .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile students at the lecture got the chance to pitch questions at the minister on a range of subjects from Maastricht to the loss of his private life .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He did kiss me back then , as if he wanted to press his wretched thin inhibited mouth right through my head .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rise in high-street spending gave a mini boost to confidence and this pushed the FT-SE 100 Index through the psychological 2,700 level .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He poured a whisky down his throat and pushed the glass across the bar for a refill .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He pushed a list across the counter .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The soldier seized me by the hair and pushed me across the garden .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Marie pushed the wheelchair along a side-street that sloped steeply down to the prom .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;O&#39;Mara &#39;s wife was shown meekly pushing a trolley along the aisles of the local Sainsbury supermarket , stuffing it with packets of biscuits .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She pushed the bike along the quay , sniffing the tarry , fishy air .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The gang of four pounced on the young mum as she was pushing her five-month-old daughter along Windsor Street , Toxteth .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every time there was a call , although 99 times out of a 100 the call was for him , he pushed the phone in my direction .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The student has to hone his skills to develop the power and speed to push the material past that limit .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If , however , the electorate does buck the trend and return George Bush to the White House , the president will face a tougher task than Clinton would in pushing his economic programme through Congress .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blindly he pushed more notes through the window and turned away .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He pushed a book towards me , and raised an eyebrow as I signed my name .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the months following his elevation , three considerations pushed Franco towards drastically altering this situation .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gazzer grabbed the wheelchair and began to push it along the paths in between the flower-beds .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Holding it back with his shoulder and managing the flashlight under his arm , Forester took one of the cards and forced it into the gap , feeling it bend stiffly as he pushed it around the edge of the door .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although Liz &#39;s body is disposing of alcohol at the rate of about one unit a hour , her last drink pushed her over the legal limit for driving of 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;` They &#39;ve shoved a bloody fish-hook down him ! &#34; exclaimed one of the men .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He shoved a paper at her .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She shoved her hand at him .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some of them stood uncomplainingly for ten hours , only shoving a bundle past them a little more forcefully than necessary .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bernice grabbed it and shoved it through the dispensing slot .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He pulled Rosheen and Klift to their feet and shoved them through the door .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You always had to spit it out and shove it down the back of some chair .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keith throws his hands above his head in the touchdown sign .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the end , she threw her pencil across the room in frustration , then paced over to the window .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I pulled off my shirt and threw it beyond the woodpile .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Silver came towards the stockade , threw his crutch over the fence , then climbed after it .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the young labourers had thrown a brick through a window , the part of the house still standing .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He saw him throw the noose towards him .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visible now only in the panoramic view , the young woman appeared to be throwing something towards the few remaining Counsellors .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Officialdom &#39;s response has been to throw more money at the problem .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Er I know there were complaints that people used to throw rubbish out of the windows .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working frantically and fast Franca dragged her clothes out of the wardrobe , carried them onto the landing and threw them down the stairs .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As he had already thrown the scotch down his throat , Neville refilled his glass .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“ He might have thrown it over the cliff . ”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She thrust the paper across the desk , then was gone almost as fast as she &#39;d come .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is quite commonplace for me to thrust my hand past my ferrets , grab a rabbit by its hind legs and pull it past the ferret .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They unlocked this gate and thrust me through it , locked it behind me .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She dropped her parcels and thrust one arm through the window .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;His eyes darkened as he thrust the cool-box towards her .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mervyn did not answer but thrust the book towards him .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She thrust the customary tip towards the croupier with a slip of paper wrapped around a plaque .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She was carrying a small spear and only just had time to raise it and thrust it at the Scarag .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Prince did n&#39;t even wait for an answer but turned to a small table beside him , slopped two goblets full of wine , rose and thrust them at his unwanted guests .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She pushed back her slim shoulders beneath the red jacket she was wearing and thrust her chin at him defiantly .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tommy had thrust a bayonet right through its belly .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the little back parlour , a coal fire , rendered more fierce by the confines of the small , black-leaded grate , thrust yellow flames up the chimney .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He took off his jacket and tossed it across a wooden bench by the fire .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She tossed the letter across the table .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He tossed a glittering object through the air .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He tossed the packet towards her a few moments later .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He drew out a pack of five cigars and tossed them towards Moss .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He tossed the money towards the bed .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He sank back into his chair as Pyke and I walked away from the table , and tossed the whisky down his throat .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So he jumps down onto the walkway and upends the body , tossing it over the side .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He smiled , taking a last draw on the cigarette before tossing it over the rail .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You must turn your back , shut your eyes , and toss it over your shoulder . &#34;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It unrolled as he tugged it across the bedroom floor , and inside was the blood-soaked corpse of Maria Shill .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mr Yarrow tugged a long card-index box across the desk and set about it with a bespittled finger .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;` Do n&#39;t be silly ! &#34; snaps the woman , tugging her offspring through the throng .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Catching her hand , he began tugging her back towards the car .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She twined her fingers through Piers &#39;s and tugged him towards the door .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She yanked Anna toward the car and did n&#39;t stop even when the child stumbled and almost fell .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He put his hand in his jacket pocket , searching for his wallet , and as he did , Doug , serious now , yanked Harry towards him and whispered in tones from which all traces of his cockney accent were now absent .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She walked across the room and , grabbing her daughter &#39;s long hair , yanked her towards the cell door .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\"\n",
