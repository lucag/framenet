    "The **valence_patterns** are the set of group realizations for the current frame. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each LU is associated with its own set of valence patterns. For a given LU, if two or more annotated sentence share **all** the same elements (e.g. same number and kind of FE/PT/GF constituents') they will be considered instances of the same single valence pattern. But, if the LUs are different, this function will produce separate valence patterns, even if all other aspects of the two valence patterns are the same. **[need to verify this!]**   Consequently, one obvious way to generalize over valence patterns is to collapse patterns in these cases (i.e. generalize over the verbs in given frame).  \n",
