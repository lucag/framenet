The following applies the constructor `Lit` to the strings `'Ext'`, `'Obj'`, `'Dep'`, and `'_'` (our wildcard) and assigns the result to the corresponding Python variables.

had lost his title , and showered Benn with coins and rubbish .</li><li>Mr Sutherland , who lives in Holland , was reunited with his 27-year-old wife Anita on the tarmac -- seconds before the DC-10 exploded , showering them with debris .</li><li>It smashed the car 's sunroof showering the family with glass .</li><li>She picked her way between them , treading with care so as not to shower things with sand .</li><li>She popped a prawn ball into her mouth and bit on it , showering him with sweet and sour sauce .</li><li>Heavy fighting had scattered the desert with damaged tanks , twisted wrecks

the cellars of Masham with McEwans 80/ and Youngers No. 3 from Edinburgh or with the new Theakstons-on-Tyne which the locals declare is a far inferior brew .</li><li>I filled a notebook with names and stories about the Revolution and planned to write a book in which all my favourites would appear .</li><li>While the shop assistant helped another customer and the children played , the 2 adults filled their pockets with rings and other valuables .</li><li>Letterman has filled his suite with striking vases of flowers .</li><li>I took the top off a ginger ale and filled a small jug with water
