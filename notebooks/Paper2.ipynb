cried Bernard , belabouring Jed with his fists , splattering cheap red wine over books and walls .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The priest took the basin of blood and spattered it against the altar .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;However , its task is made much more difficult by the fact that derogations granted to the Welsh water authority allow it to pump raw sewage into both those rivers .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The longer we continue to pump lead into the atmosphere , the more it will accumulate .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Suffolk Water Company is pumping specially dechlorinated water into the habitat of the fen raft spider , Britain &#39;s largest and rarest , to save it from extinction .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;However , once the salt fingers are formed , they are pumping salty fluid into the top of the bottom layer and less salty fluid into the bottom of the top layer .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This has been open to doubt since June 8 , 1989 when an extreme left-wing group pumped 20 bullets into Valenzuela &#39;s former chief , ` Wally &#34; Fuentes Morrison .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carter toppled over and lay pumping his blood onto the canteen floor .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They will pump waste water to an existing sewer at Crosby Road South and then to North West Water &#39;s multimillion pound treatment works at Sandon Dock .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vital messages from the brain to the body slow down and nerves in the heart , sensing something is wrong , react by instructing the heart to pump extra blood to the brain .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The following week tests were carried out and I went with Dad to watch the Brigade endeavouring to pump water to the roof of Blooms the Drapers on The Canal -- possibly the City &#39;s tallest building .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One possibility being considered is for solar power to be used to pump downstream water back up to the main reservoir , so restoring the head of water needed to generate hydro-electric power .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A valuable way of concealing them is to have bars , stripes or blobs of colour that appear to overflow from one section to the next , as though someone has splashed ink across the animal .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Betty watched him as he splashed a little soda in each , and handed her one .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He splashed whiskey into the glasses .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Edward lifted it and splashed a little water into the teapot , swirling it around .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She splashed water on her face , wishing she had her overnight case up here with her , wondering if it would be possible to make a deal with Ace .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The extreme force of the blows had splashed blood on the walls and ceilings .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Church of England vicar blessed the Northamp stately home , splashed holy water on the walls and said prayers to ward off the spirit .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cupping his hands in the large jug , he splashed cold water over his face and chest , rubbing it up and down his arms before towelling himself down .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I splashed water over my face , slicked unruly grey hair into a more reasonable disorder , and headed down to the lobby again .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In fact , she thought as she splashed cold water on to her hot face , she had n&#39;t seen him all morning -- perhaps he &#39;d taken himself off for a walk .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He splashed some down the front of my tunic and was gone .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eddie splashed more of the liquid against his temples , brushing it back and then rubbing it in with a comb .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I splashed more over my face .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some female handed them a hypo-bulb and they sprayed it into Jezrael &#39;s face , and there was a physical paralysis leadening her without physical pain .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He unswung the machine-gun and sprayed the bullets into the trees , sending his hunters scattering for cover .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Angry farmer sprays muck on a council&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They sprayed cold water on my dog when it was snowing and all her fur froze .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We ca n&#39;t blame them that vandals spray paint on the walls .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When he saw us he choked and sprayed the beer onto the lawn .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He shook his head , spraying drops over the room , over his clothes discarded on the floor .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mojo shook the thing fiercely , spraying ink over the station head .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Farmers in the region are not allowed to spray manure over the surface of their fields .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The combat unit had sprayed napalm or some napalm analogue into the Silver Shuriken , and he was clothed in fire .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Battling Dave Cannon sprayed a whole trailer-load of the cow muck over a council building after plans for his retirement bungalow were turned down for the fourth time .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Watching the Turks spray it around the park against our implacable foes , the English recently , the mystery deepened as to how we managed to knock in five goals against them at Lansdowne Road .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He crouched behind the mother to squirt milk into the bottle .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A handsome Irish youth with ginger hair squirted some boiling water into the teapot and swilled a cup of dark brown liquid into a chipped cup .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is a superbly efficient food gatherer , and can siphon ten gallons of water at a single suck and squirt this into the elephant &#39;s mouth .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For many of them , the classroom will be the first place where they are able to play with water and even spill it on the floor without incurring an adult &#39;s displeasure .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\"\n",

Arpège &#34; .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They plastered a considerable number of parked aircraft with sticky labels marked ` bomb &#34; : the station commander reportedly was furious the following morning .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And if the stranger has pleased the local cattle they will show their gratitude by plastering the sides of the vehicle with a generous dolloping of fresh dung before they depart .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;` I could go upstairs this minute and drape myself in gold chains and beautiful bracelets . &#34;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;During the second number , he draped himself in the Union Jack , presumably in an attempt to endear himself to the bulldog breed .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She then draped it with vivid red silk , secured in place with a glue gun .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She changed her shoes , did her hair , dabbed her neck with Chanel and slammed the bedroom door .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I &#39;m not here to be a dolly , dabbing his temples with eau de cologne and picking up his wife &#39;s laundry .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She dabbed her lips with salt water again and crumbled some of the roasted chicken neck into her mouth .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have pricked my first blister , squeezed out the fluid , and dabbed it with surgical spirit .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#34; I had to do extra rehearsals because I was new and she would daub my legs with methylated spirits and iodine .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It was a good thought as she made ready for bed ; then , her one luxury , she daubed her face with night-cream .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The previous user had also daubed the ducts along the roof of Biff &#39;s control bubble with vermilion slogans .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alan Hirst , 39 , who has a rare allergy , injected himself with adrenalin after he was stung at Bawtry , Doncaster .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Murray , he alleged , then had gone to the bothy next door where he had injected three men with heroin .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mr Goldring claimed Allitt had injected her with insulin and said a test after her death had found a high level of the drug in her blood .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mr Goldring claimed she had injected one baby with potassium .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teams of scuba divers have injected thousands of them with copper .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The apartment itself was enormous and , as if she were scared of the space , Jane Pargeter had crammed it with expensive furniture .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile her lads Lester and Luke are cramming her tights with toys and the baby is smearing lipstick all over himself .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He seeds your body with human fragments ,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monteith has painted several of the wooden floors with colourful designs , hung the doors with attractive plaques , and repainted many of the original desks and chairs in cheerful pastel shades .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Women were remarking on the window hangings -- ` You could hang my whole downstairs with one of those red curtains , &#34;

, a plain white canvas , flush with the wall ; and Martin Gostner has sprayed a column with transparent glue , sticky but invisible .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;However , to date , the best method I have tried is to spray the lengths of yarn with silicone spray .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Times Beach unwittingly became contaminated ten years ago , when trucks sprayed the town &#39;s unpaved streets with waste oil containing dioxin , an extremely toxic byproduct of a common herbicide .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the end , assisted by the two younger priests , he came through the altar rails and sprinkled the coffin with Holy Water .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anna emptied cornflakes out of the packet until her bowl was piled high , sprinkled the pile with sugar and doused it in milk , then sat staring at it while the sugar dissolved and the cornflakes drooped .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The small Irishman had just sprinkled the wooden floor with water to keep down the dust and was briskly sweeping the warped boards with a long-bristled broom when Patrick arrived .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eva liked to sprinkle the house with about five papers and three magazines a day , skimming over Vogue and the New Statesman and the Daily Express before dumping the lot into the wastepaper basket beside the bed .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Within a few days of laying I place the egg mass in a dish , and squirt it with tank water from a pipette .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But the cornice offers no aid and he tumbles and slithers down once more , cursing and swearing and showering me in snow .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Italian crowd went berserk when they realised their man had lost his title , and showered Benn with coins and rubbish .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mr Sutherland , who lives in Holland , was reunited with his 27-year-old wife Anita on the tarmac -- seconds before the DC-10 exploded , showering them with debris .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It smashed the car &#39;s sunroof showering the family with glass .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She picked her way between them , treading with care so as not to shower things with sand .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She popped a prawn ball into her mouth and bit on it , showering him with sweet and sour sauce .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heavy fighting had scattered the desert with damaged tanks , twisted wrecks that once were jeeps and burned-out trucks stuck head-first in deep sand drifts .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alexei leaned a little to one side so that a slave could heap his plate with k&#39;va , the staple grain which was similar to rice .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The vandals broke into the house , piled the cooker with linen then switched it on and set light to it .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;` Only teasing you , Wraysford , &#34; said Harrington , piling his plate with the fried eggs , which had started to congeal beneath the cover .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After he &#39;d coated the segments in salt and chilli he passed them round , and everyone smacked their lips and screwed up their faces in pained delight .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will certainly need to experiment with exposure periods if you are coating your own boards with a UV sensitive aerosol lacquer .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I filled the crack above with belay nuts , tied off , and eventually relaxed enough to hang into my harness and haul in the rope .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But he could fill a flask with coffee .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They could have filled the cellars of Masham with McEwans 80/ and Youngers No. 3 from Edinburgh or with the new Theakstons-on-Tyne which the locals declare is a far inferior brew .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I filled a notebook with names and stories about the Revolution and planned to write a book in which all my favourites would appear .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While the shop assistant helped another customer and the children played , the 2 adults filled their pockets with rings and other valuables .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Letterman has filled his suite with striking vases of flowers .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I took the top off a ginger ale and filled a small jug with water .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Part of the fun yesterday was when Lander doused the walking hero with a bucket of sea water .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are a film star and smoke a particular brand of cigar or douse yourself with an exotic perfume then you would be a prime candidate to appear in adverts endorsing these products .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He had a video camera on his shoulder last November , when a mob doused three thieves with petrol and looked on as they burned .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anna emptied cornflakes out of the packet until her bowl was piled high , sprinkled the pile with sugar and doused it in milk , then sat staring at it while the sugar dissolved and the cornflakes drooped .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mr Chittenden had already doused himself in a flammable liquid and set himself alight .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Though , personally , she felt as if someone had injected her brain with a paralysing solution .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We put it to bed in a bowl and cover it in bulb fibre like a blanket .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One girl wanted to cover him in whipped cream and honey and then slowly lick off every bit .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She covered her mouth with her hand .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Overcome again , she covered her face with her hands and sank onto the settee .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I caught the little boy , but when the child saw me , he covered his eyes with his hands and screamed loudly .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We all found him interesting , so when we lay in the sun after lunch , the white gravel covering our backs with powdery marks , his fighting demonstrations were keenly attended .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He wiped his hands on the wet grass beside the grave and ordered the reluctant soldier back to secure the lid of the coffin and cover it with soil .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eva had to cover a chair in stapled-together plastic bags before it was hygienic enough for his arse .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aware now that he was more naked than the other man he turned to the bed , and dragged a sheet off it to cover himself with .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two people were in the living room , a man and a woman , both in uniform , dusting the various surfaces with whitish powder .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Within the hour the good beachcombers are on the spot and loading their sacks with all manner of bounties cast at their feet by providence .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Preferring a neutral approach for such material , Sylvester has not loaded the catalogue with critical judgements .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;` That Geoffrey is a wicked geezer , &#34; Toss said to himself , as he began to load the pram with Geoffrey &#39;s computing equipment .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He loaded the barrow with paving stones before running straight through a plate glass window at the B&amp;Q superstore in South Shields .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two girls are loading the donkeys with water containers and sacks .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just as you should not overload your argument with cases , you should not load it with too many separate points of law .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have the choice of being snooty and tutting at people sitting in their cars , packing their faces with hot dogs , or you can pack your own face with a hot dog before you set out .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He packed his suitcases with clothes and books .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;His lectures were above all popular because he packed them with information .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did as she said but they were two sizes too big for me ; they fitted better after she had packed the toes with scraps of wool .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When at last the work was finished , Mina and Kāli packed a basket with some clean clothes and went together to the stream to wash .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now the programme that turns the cameras on teenagers and let&#39;s them do the talking and the interviews has packed its newest series with just the subjects their viewers want .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He did not even notice when one of his class became stuck in the hole in the floorboards and was there all day until Endill had the idea of smearing him with butter to slide him out .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They were both bareheaded , but had smeared their faces with camouflage cream , and wore dark coloured zip-up windcheaters , denims and trainers .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He had smeared the shape with coal dust .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At all times , the BBC and official propaganda has been industrious at smearing them with crime and violence .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He smeared the chicken with edenwort , okra and gravy , rubbed it round the plate and set it off once more in the direction of his wide , beautifully moulded mouth .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He promptly took it out of her hand , smeared it with honey and pushed it towards her mouth .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She was smearing her hands with iron oxide , to simulate blood .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The women of the family struck their faces and smeared them with soot .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They also knew that the arrested men were respectable and law-abiding and they were highly indignant when they heard that an official spokesman had smeared them with the suggestion of criminal activities .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bryony took the toast out and began to smear it with tomato chutney .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The man &#39;s face was a glistening red , as though he had smeared it with Vaseline .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In nineteenth-century Paris young revellers would melt down chocolate and smear horrified passers-by with what they took to be excrement .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She spread the bed with a blue and crimson Indian blanket , put up lampshades , hung blue curtains .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The decorations committee had spent the morning spreading tables with brown , yellow and green linen cloths and pinning gold-sprayed autumn leaves to each corner of them .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She broke off a piece of baguette , spread it with butter and jam , stuffed it into her mouth .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;` My Grandma Rosenbloom used to spread hers with chicken fat .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She spread butter on to a deliciously aromatic roll , and spread it with honey , adding calmly , ` This is your villa .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I &#39;ve stuffed myself with bread in your brother &#39;s today .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Needlessly Herr Nordern cleared his throat again , frowning at Paul who was goggling at him while stuffing himself with cheese and cold ham .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He tore a roll open , stuffed it with cut ham and gave her that .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I sat with her , gave her my drink bottle , stuffed her with glucose and encouraged her to rest for a while .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The naan bread was big ; we &#39;d both stuffed ourselves with it during the meal but it was still big .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We sat stuffing ourselves with smoked-salmon sandwiches , slurping Earl Grey , while she charmed and intimidated them with her stolen airs and purloined graces .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They would wrap the lamb in a warm blanket , feed it from a bottle , and keep it near the heat of the kitchen fire , perhaps even on top of the oven , until it recovered .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wrapped him in the big blanket we &#39;d brought as he was already shivering .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He wrapped the material in sheets of brown paper .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doug told Sergeant Flynn what had happened , the ambulance people wrapped Mac &#39;s body in his bed sheet and took him off under the harsh lights set up by the TV crew .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wrapped up a bottle of Grand Moulas in a newspaper for safety , put it in one of the panniers and went on my way .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The apothecary took my money , wrapped up a bottle in blue paper and handed it over , hardly looking at me .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More workers were twining vines of ivy around pillars newly painted orange , while an elderly woman was strewing the floor with French chalk so that the dancing shoes would not slip on the polished parquet .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If she started to strew the floor with objects she received a firm warning then , if she persisted , her mother took her wrists and made her pick up and replace each object .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Their bid was blocked on grounds that seemed contrived : the MMC purported to be worried , eg , that Lonrho might flood Harrods with nylon sheets made by one of its subsidiaries .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both before , and when , the Nazis took over Poland they flooded the bookstalls of that country with pornography .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The papers you are working on are fairly heavy and , unless you are flooding the paper with watercolour , should stand up to washes without the need for stretching .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SOFT drinks giant PepsiCo has adorned the front cover of its annual report with pictures of cute white bunnies .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;` Your man , they tell me , adorned you with jewels and fine gowns .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;` I &#39;m going to ask you questions , Madeleine , and every time you answer no , I shall adorn you with one of these pegs .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They adorned the perimeter fence with pictures , flowers , and messages of peace .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The priests offered [ this ] idol flowers , incense and food and adorned it with wreaths of flowers and garlands of feathers History of Things of new Spain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He had adorned his new abode at Winchelsea with the finest furniture from a firm in London &#39;s New Bond Street and , although well able to afford it , he had failed to pay .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nor were donors always royalty : the wife of Cnut &#39;s henchman Tofi the Proud adorned a crucifix at Waltham in Essex with a crown , as well as decking it with other ornaments .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Her bruises stung badly as she anointed herself with gel , but the discomfort was a small price to pay for feeling clean again .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What father would anoint his child with such a leaden armour of expectations ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Indians then anoint the tips of their arrows with the poison .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over 200 species of birds have been seen anointing themselves with these substances .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He anointed himself again with vaseline , bruised the jelly into his nose .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Donald Buttress &#39; solution was to tile the roof with ridged composition tiles of a greenish grey hue , which from below look remarkably similar to slates and blend very well with the stonework .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He built them a pagoda of solid jade and embellished it with precious gems -- not realising that to grow up a dragon must accumulate its own hoard , must steal it from Emperors and princes .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You may wish to embellish the controls with rubdown lettering followed by a coat of spray-on protective lacquer as usual .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teenagers can embellish their denims with plaited braids and cords from Madeira &#39;s Shoeshines .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Their defense , often crowding the line with eight men , did a decent job on Sanders , who now has 1,721 yards in his bid for a 2,000-yard season .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\"\n",

Fuentes Morrison .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carter toppled over and lay pumping his blood onto the canteen floor .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They will pump waste water to an existing sewer at Crosby Road South and then to North West Water &#39;s multimillion pound treatment works at Sandon Dock .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vital messages from the brain to the body slow down and nerves in the heart , sensing something is wrong , react by instructing the heart to pump extra blood to the brain .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The following week tests were carried out and I went with Dad to watch the Brigade endeavouring to pump water to the roof of Blooms the Drapers on The Canal -- possibly the City &#39;s tallest building .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One possibility being considered is for solar power to be used to pump downstream water back up to the main reservoir , so restoring the head of water needed to generate hydro-electric power .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A valuable way of concealing them is to have bars , stripes or blobs of colour that appear to overflow from one section to the next , as though someone has splashed ink across the animal .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Betty watched him as he splashed a little soda in each , and handed her one .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He splashed whiskey into the glasses .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Edward lifted it and splashed a little water into the teapot , swirling it around .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She splashed water on her face , wishing she had her overnight case up here with her , wondering if it would be possible to make a deal with Ace .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The extreme force of the blows had splashed blood on the walls and ceilings .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Church of England vicar blessed the Northamp stately home , splashed holy water on the walls and said prayers to ward off the spirit .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cupping his hands in the large jug , he splashed cold water over his face and chest , rubbing it up and down his arms before towelling himself down .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I splashed water over my face , slicked unruly grey hair into a more reasonable disorder , and headed down to the lobby again .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In fact , she thought as she splashed cold water on to her hot face , she had n&#39;t seen him all morning -- perhaps he &#39;d taken himself off for a walk .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He splashed some down the front of my tunic and was gone .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eddie splashed more of the liquid against his temples , brushing it back and then rubbing it in with a comb .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I splashed more over my face .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some female handed them a hypo-bulb and they sprayed it into Jezrael &#39;s face , and there was a physical paralysis leadening her without physical pain .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He unswung the machine-gun and sprayed the bullets into the trees , sending his hunters scattering for cover .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Angry farmer sprays muck on a council&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They sprayed cold water on my dog when it was snowing and all her fur froze .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We ca n&#39;t blame them that vandals spray paint on the walls .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When he saw us he choked and sprayed the beer onto the lawn .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He shook his head , spraying drops over the room , over his clothes discarded on the floor .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mojo shook the thing fiercely , spraying ink over the station head .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Farmers in the region are not allowed to spray manure over the surface of their fields .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The combat unit had sprayed napalm or some napalm analogue into the Silver Shuriken , and he was clothed in fire .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Battling Dave Cannon sprayed a whole trailer-load of the cow muck over a council building after plans for his retirement bungalow were turned down for the fourth time .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Watching the Turks spray it around the park against our implacable foes , the English recently , the mystery deepened as to how we managed to knock in five goals against them at Lansdowne Road .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He crouched behind the mother to squirt milk into the bottle .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A handsome Irish youth with ginger hair squirted some boiling water into the teapot and swilled a cup of dark brown liquid into a chipped cup .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is a superbly efficient food gatherer , and can siphon ten gallons of water at a single suck and squirt this into the elephant &#39;s mouth .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For many of them , the classroom will be the first place where they are able to play with water and even spill it on the floor without incurring an adult &#39;s displeasure .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\"\n",

full of pupils and a girl was quite badly injured .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Divorce or the death of a husband is enough to catapult a middle-class white woman and her children into poverty .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She chucks a bath towel to me .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;` Wilhelm wo n&#39;t speak to me since I chucked his Filofax in the jacuzzi .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can chuck me in the river , if you like , for all the good I am to meself .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We chucked their livers into a large barrel fastened to the mast ; these were sold for cod-liver oil and the money they fetched was the perquisite of the crew .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He chucks it into the sea .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The modern manager establishes his machismo , not by creating a business that can employ thousands , but by buying a business and then chucking all his supposedly supernumerary workers on the dole .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you just chuck it on the floor , then someone s got to come round alter you and pick it up .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In Ancient Rome they &#39;d have chucked him to the lions .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dolly chucked the pack at him .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Marie yelled after me to wait but I did n&#39;t want to talk to her about it so I chucked my sandwich-box over to her and told her she could eat them for me .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You ca n&#39;t run with a baby , and I &#39;m not going to drag my kids into the sort of life I &#39;ve been living .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then I got up and took the two rugs by their corners and dragged them outside the door .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lucenzo swept over to her , caught her arm and dragged her to the entrance of the ballroom .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He was looking pleased with himself as he dragged the table to the side of the room to make space to work in .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cornelius dragged the portmanteau towards the inn door .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With a sob , Theda flung her arms about his neck and buried her face in his shoulder .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the group then grabbed the boy and flung him against a wall .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Robbie screamed and flung herself against the protective width of Fen &#39;s chest .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kate flung her arms around him and wept for joy .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Milton flung himself in his chair and buried his head in his hands .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then , in the very same breath , she snatched up the toppled coffee-cup and flung the lukewarm contents in his face .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Barton scooped up all the bits of paper and flung them into the air .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suddenly they all surged towards me and flung their coins into the canvas sheet I was guarding and one old codger decided to go home .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He unzipped his black jacket and flung it on a chair .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The customers in return sneered at the clothing offered to them , and flung it on the ground .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He flung the helmet on the ground and Philip grabbed it .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In we would climb , rolling up hats and coats and flinging them onto the back seat .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The men flung a net over me .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She flung herself to the floor and rolled to safety behind the half-opened door , the Beretta clenched tightly in her gloved hand .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;` Oh , yer swine , &#34; breathed the young woman as he flung the handbag to the ground .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She flung the tape at him .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JUST AS THE PANTING CYCLIST drew ahead of the London to St Alban &#39;s coach the guard hurled an iron ball on a rope into the spokes of the bicycle wheel and felled the rider .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two fiesty little Yorkshire terriers leap off his lap and hurl their combined body weight of two grapefruits against my legs .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He suddenly grabbed the beer can and hurled it against the wall then upturned the table , sending it crashing against the cooker .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I followed them onto a narrow , crumbling ledge above the ravine where the wind hurled us against the wall .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Speechless with rage , Mait hurled the card in the Doctor &#39;s face before storming out of the cell .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;C&#39;zinsit hurled himself into the saddle and charged away .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;David Gower survives a caught-behind appeal off Mushtaq , provoking substitute Rashid Latif ( centre , in cap ) into a dash down the length of the pitch , where he hurled his cap to the ground .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He hurled himself at the boy .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years , and by now she ought to be totally immune to them .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Earlier this month Mr Cossiga publicly hurled the epithet ‘ son of a … ’ at a British journalist who described Italy &#39;s military contribution to the Gulf war as a ‘ token force ’ .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;` I hurled my shirt down because I was so angry -- I felt cheated .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lindsey rose to her feet , nudging a drawer to a close .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After the nest is complete and around 30cm in diameter , the male nudges the female under it and egg laying begins .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The boilerhouse bridge needed repairing before it pitched us all into the river .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The girls plan to to pitch their talents against the boys at the end of term , so they &#39;re getting as much practice as possible .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He had smiled at the frontier guards and kept walking with his rucksack slung over one shoulder … until the hand had clamped on his collar , and the boots had pitched him into a cell .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Erm I &#39;d like to pitch another figure into the debate , er because I do n&#39;t agree with the County Council on this either .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And yet , if Mr Brown does pitch his hat into the gubernatorial contest , he will start with a handicap .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you try to pitch the ball onto the top , particularly working from a tight lie , you will find it almost impossible to pull the ball up quickly enough .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instantly Harriet pressed her hand across her mouth in a theatrical gesture .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The surgeon presses his stethoscope in my hands : ` What is your opinion of this patient ? &#34; he asks .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He pressed his thumb in the hollow of one of her cheeks and circled it , rubbing it abrasively over her trembling lips .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She pressed herself into her corner of the sofa .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He pressed his face into her hair .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He knocked my gun from my hand then pushed me up against the wall , pressing his own gun into my stomach .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He pressed his face into the pillow to conceal the sound of a sobbing he could not control .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She pressed a firm finger on the bell .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She groaned , pressing her hands over her ears , but it was n&#39;t that simple to cut off the insidious little voice .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She was hardly breathing when , his lips warm and gentle , he pressed a light kiss to her cheek .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lou pressed her hands to her eyes .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The glass ball &#39;s pretty warm now and I press it to my cheek and sort of roll it against my skin .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cornelius knelt and pressed an ear to the keyhole of the closed door .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He groaned , caught her hand in his and pressed his mouth to the palm .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He pressed his brow against the coolness of the pane , and shut his eyes .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After 1970 , the operation of union membership agreements pushed overall membership consistently above 90 per cent , and for some grades such as train drivers , unionization has been virtually total .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The shoots were pushing their heads above the ground even though the group was still able to claim record profits as late as January of this year .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She pushed her chair against the table .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Staring at him in confusion , she hauled herself upright in the bed and pushed the pillow behind her .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She pushed a chair behind him and he dropped on to it , sitting forward , gripping the sideboard .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There were newspapers on a table , the story was on an open page and if Marshall had not closed the paper and pushed it beneath others , Wickham &#39;s curiosity would not have been aroused .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She pushed a cigarette between her dry lips then fumbled in her coat pocket for a lighter and , cupping her trembling fingers around the flame , lit it and inhaled deeply .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When she saw where I was sitting she pushed her hands in her coat pockets and ambled over on her shaky heels .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She must have forgotten a few things in the holidays , like the time I pushed her in the school goldfish pond .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alice crumpled it up and pushed it into the kitchen bin .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;` Are you suggesting Joseph pushed her into the water as she walked through the harbour ? &#34;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cranston pushed his face to the grille .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Somebody had pushed a note under his door .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He dropped the lot into a shoe box and pushed them under the bed .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sammy wriggled into his arms and pushed his head underneath Tom &#39;s chin .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He grabbed Farrell again and pushed his face within inches .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A EUROPEAN ruling today pushed Britain closer to being placed in the dock over the killing by SAS soldiers in Gibraltar of three IRA terrorists .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dolly pushed the cruet across .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;` Syrup , Mother ? &#34; said Jimmy , pushing the tin across .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We could shove the other one in the wreck of the old car . &#34;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then she shoved the sketch pad back into the bag .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A waitress shoved a plate of cocktail bits beneath Joshua &#39;s nose .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She reached the house , ran into the front room and shoved the suitcase behind a big , glass case that had a capercailzie in it .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She went into the bathroom and I made my own supper by slicing some of the foul cheese and shoving it between two slices of greased plastic bread .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then he shoved the letter in his jacket pocket and stood .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He shoved my shirt in my mouth first , so I would n&#39;t make a noise . &#34;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yesterday he was at Hartlepool Labour Hall , surrounded by a dozen or so women shoving leaflets into envelopes .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;` Aye , go on you , I &#39;ll shove the kettle on the fire , a cup of tea always helps things along . &#34;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So they just shove some tape over it .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did n&#39;t move back , although he shoved his face close to mine .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She hung the apron over the back of a chair , shoved the sauce under a covering plate , turned off the gas under the fish-kettle in which herb-scented water had begun to simmer .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He shoved Gorelli against the Chrysler with his gun and pulled the rear door open .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He pulled the pistol free and shoved it against Hitch &#39;s cheek .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They hit many patches of soft sand and wasted hours unloading vehicles , shoving them up to the top of dunes and reloading again .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whitlock shoved him back onto a tarpaulin in the corner of the warehouse and scooped up the Browning .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hartlepool magistrates heard that he allegedly threw a petrol bomb into the rear of the premises .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Auguste rushed to the kitchen across the corridor , returning with a bottle of water , hotly pursued by Boris , and threw it all over Fouchard .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Corbett repeated his instructions and , throwing his cloak about him , went downstairs .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We threw ourselves against the door , and as the lock broke we went in .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When John threw him against the foam sofa unit , it tipped over backward and he cracked his head against the window behind , splitting the glass .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unable to sleep and seeing Madame &#39;s bedroom light still on , she had thrown a pebble against the glass and called her down .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When it goes off you throw it against the wall to stop the noise .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She ejected the clip and threw it amongst a pile of discarded wooden crates in the corner of the shed , then buried the rifle under a mound of rubble in the pockmarked skip .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both parents got very emotional and threw their arms around her , although she had never felt they were very close before .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He pulled it off and threw it behind him , revealing himself naked to the waist .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Government &#39;s chances of forcing debate into the small hours against Labour and rebel Tory opposition were boosted when the Liberal Democrats threw their weight behind the procedural Commons motion .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What safety they offered was debatable , but if worst came to worst he would throw himself beneath a car , and deny the voiders the entertainment of his slow demise .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instinctively , she darted forward , throwing herself between them .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She had heard the cops on Plenty did n&#39;t even bother throwing you in jail .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And once he had heard Sweetheart coming down the stairs , her high-heels ringing on the stone steps , and he had thrown the stolen food in Rosie &#39;s corner in a panic .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Despite the time lost , he threw himself into his work and eventually , with a good brain and a determination to achieve , obtained qualification to become a surgeon in a children &#39;s hospital .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The boy waved his stick round his head and threw it into the pool .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On their way to the station she would not throw her coin into the Trevi Fountain .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feathers , who was not Harry &#39;s father , told the court he threw the baby on the bed because he would not stop crying .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the nature of such a vibration can be established it may throw some light on the nature of the electronic band .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And he took out the keys and threw them onto the bonnet .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flora blew her nose into the pristine handkerchief , scrunched it into a ball and threw it onto the linoleum floor .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The barman returned , smiled , and threw the liquid over his face .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And a businessman in Middlesbrough threw eight thousand pounds to masked raiders who rammed his car .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paramount have thrown caution to the wind and employed MICHAEL CIMINO to write and direct a movie entitled Heaven Is A Sometime Thing .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He ran to help and found that , instead of repairing it , men were thrusting what they could into carts , still under its netting .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He thrust the coin among his clothes and started to run away but turned back to say , ` You a Yankee , Mister ? &#34;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When Sarah was leaving , Maggie thrust a parcel in her arms .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He thrust both hands in his pockets and rocked back on his heels .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He leaned back in his chair and thrust his hands inside his trouser pockets .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It was cold and he thrust his hands deeper inside the pockets of his coat .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finally he stood up , thrusting his hands into the pockets of his black trousers .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He thrust a sandwich on a plate in front of her .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Michael impatiently thrust him on one side and brought out the sack .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But a moment later he was up again and had thrust his head over the back of the board .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sam thrust his leg over the sill .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tzann thrust the sealed orders to one side , on top of a small pile of unopened mail .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He cursed himself inwardly and tried to thrust the whole matter to the back of his mind .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A brave reporter thrust a microphone under his nose and asked him for his comments .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The whisper made him stir in his sleep , turning and thrusting one arm under the pillow .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ace tried to thrust a ghostly neural net crystal underneath the Doctor &#39;s nose and only succeeded in pushing it out of the image field .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then she thrust a foot against her husband &#39;s side , saying , ` You had your answer , did n&#39;t you ? &#34;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A white line of fury around his mouth , he lifted the gold locket around her neck and , opening it with his thumbnail , thrust it before her eyes .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;` Yes , &#34; she agreed , tossing the offending garment back on to the bed .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bliss turned on his heel and , pausing only to toss his cigarette end into one of the fire buckets , sauntered out of the hotel lobby .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paul pulled several cubes of sugar from his pocket and tossed them among the children , and they squealed and fought among themselves , passing the prizes eventually from hand to hand .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the station I pick up my other parcel from Left Luggage , and toss it in a holdall .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That way , when you bust your board , you do n&#39;t just toss it in the garbage .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ymor crumpled the note and tossed it into a corner .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Taking it out , she ripped it into tiny pieces then tossed the fragments into the bucket that still stood on the dresser like some awful avant-garde ornament .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With two brisk movements she wrenched the wire loose and tossed the microphone into the water .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He took out the letter and tossed it on the counter .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tossed the paper on the desk and looked moodily out of the window .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting out , he tossed the cap on the seat , wrestled off the uniform , exposing the lightweight dark suit he wore under it .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The man strode into the centre of the room and tossed his hat onto a chair .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Graham took an envelope from his pocket and tossed it onto the sofa .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He had tossed his coat over the back of a chair and was pouring whiskies .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He tossed the plans to one side .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He took two pears from a bowl and tossed one to Rostov .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But if I were Ben Hogan , and a Bob Hamilton or Willie Goggin chipped in to beat me in The Masters , a Walter Burkemo holed a sand shot to swipe the PGA , a raw rookie -- pick one -- holed a 7-iron to beat me somewhere in Florida and then the like of a Bud Holscher or a Shelley Mayfield holed yet another sand shot to steal yet another victory , then I &#39;d not only be scouring the Fort Worth Yellow Pages looking for the nearest shrink , I might even think of tossing myself under a freight train in the nearest marshalling yard .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He turned and tossed a penny at the lad still squatting in the corner .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ace slid to the floor and cleared a space around her by tossing dead creatures on to the pile of bodies in the middle of the cabin .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now he was content to release him , to toss him back in the water like a catch unworthy of the landing .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Holly took the bread and tugged it between his fingers and wolfed it to his mouth .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He tugged a fur-lined hat over his cropped white hair as he approached the transit van , his eyes riveted on Vasili &#39;s face .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The weight of the engine tugged his nose down and he had to keep tugging it up again .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fearon dragged it on over his sweater , tugged a disreputable flat cap over his wet hair and set off briskly towards the yard .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grabbing her by the arm , he yanked her to her feet .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;FitzAlan reached down and yanked her to her feet .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He propelled her towards the door and flung it wide dragging her out onto the landing .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cupboard doors were flying , the trash can in the kitchen walked a few feet , the dogs came running , and I scooted them into the dog run and stood in the doorway myself , watching the outside trash cans dance across the concrete .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh , they &#39;d have to move it to Taiwan for people not to know about it practically .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Democrats forced the Senate into a rare closed door session .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dai-Siu ( Big and Small ) is a dice game in which the croupier throws three dice inside a glass container

he pulled Lazlo &#39;s map from his pocket and flung it across the table , ` The great detective left this behind when he and Rex fled from his office last night .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The last word was a terrible scream and as she screamed it she flung the glass in the direction of Eddie although I &#39;m pretty sure she was n&#39;t aiming at anyone in particular .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another dealer owed a few hundred pounds by the director of a firm he had just left , drove one night with some friends to his house , where they flung bricks through every window .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Balberith ripped the remains of the fruit and salad bar from its mountings and flung it through the roof .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With a final contemptuous glance she lifted the calliper by its straps and flung it over the small cliff .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the presence of a few hundred Masai , the young warrior hurled his spear right through the district officer &#39;s heart .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The gaunt woman hurled his plastic pistol after him .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At last he sat back , tousled and infuriated , crumpled the cheque and hurled it across the room .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dashwood let out a howl of frustration and hurled Farrell across the room .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He hurled a chair across the set , smashing lamps and vases , then stormed off to his dressing room .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ellen hurled the still discharging extinguisher over the side .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then , when the boy was n&#39;t looking in his direction he hurled it towards the pool .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They hurled potatoes at firemen trying to douse a bonfire of tyres in the town &#39;s central square , prompting riot police to fire tear gas .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So I nudged Martin in the direction of a mindless blonde divorcee .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He would pitch a dead tree over the front fence .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile students at the lecture got the chance to pitch questions at the minister on a range of subjects from Maastricht to the loss of his private life .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He did kiss me back then , as if he wanted to press his wretched thin inhibited mouth right through my head .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rise in high-street spending gave a mini boost to confidence and this pushed the FT-SE 100 Index through the psychological 2,700 level .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He poured a whisky down his throat and pushed the glass across the bar for a refill .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He pushed a list across the counter .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The soldier seized me by the hair and pushed me across the garden .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Marie pushed the wheelchair along a side-street that sloped steeply down to the prom .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;O&#39;Mara &#39;s wife was shown meekly pushing a trolley along the aisles of the local Sainsbury supermarket , stuffing it with packets of biscuits .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She pushed the bike along the quay , sniffing the tarry , fishy air .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The gang of four pounced on the young mum as she was pushing her five-month-old daughter along Windsor Street , Toxteth .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every time there was a call , although 99 times out of a 100 the call was for him , he pushed the phone in my direction .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The student has to hone his skills to develop the power and speed to push the material past that limit .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If , however , the electorate does buck the trend and return George Bush to the White House , the president will face a tougher task than Clinton would in pushing his economic programme through Congress .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blindly he pushed more notes through the window and turned away .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He pushed a book towards me , and raised an eyebrow as I signed my name .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the months following his elevation , three considerations pushed Franco towards drastically altering this situation .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gazzer grabbed the wheelchair and began to push it along the paths in between the flower-beds .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Holding it back with his shoulder and managing the flashlight under his arm , Forester took one of the cards and forced it into the gap , feeling it bend stiffly as he pushed it around the edge of the door .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although Liz &#39;s body is disposing of alcohol at the rate of about one unit a hour , her last drink pushed her over the legal limit for driving of 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;` They &#39;ve shoved a bloody fish-hook down him ! &#34; exclaimed one of the men .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He shoved a paper at her .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She shoved her hand at him .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some of them stood uncomplainingly for ten hours , only shoving a bundle past them a little more forcefully than necessary .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bernice grabbed it and shoved it through the dispensing slot .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He pulled Rosheen and Klift to their feet and shoved them through the door .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You always had to spit it out and shove it down the back of some chair .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keith throws his hands above his head in the touchdown sign .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the end , she threw her pencil across the room in frustration , then paced over to the window .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I pulled off my shirt and threw it beyond the woodpile .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Silver came towards the stockade , threw his crutch over the fence , then climbed after it .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the young labourers had thrown a brick through a window , the part of the house still standing .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He saw him throw the noose towards him .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visible now only in the panoramic view , the young woman appeared to be throwing something towards the few remaining Counsellors .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Officialdom &#39;s response has been to throw more money at the problem .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Er I know there were complaints that people used to throw rubbish out of the windows .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working frantically and fast Franca dragged her clothes out of the wardrobe , carried them onto the landing and threw them down the stairs .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As he had already thrown the scotch down his throat , Neville refilled his glass .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“ He might have thrown it over the cliff . ”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She thrust the paper across the desk , then was gone almost as fast as she &#39;d come .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is quite commonplace for me to thrust my hand past my ferrets , grab a rabbit by its hind legs and pull it past the ferret .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They unlocked this gate and thrust me through it , locked it behind me .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She dropped her parcels and thrust one arm through the window .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;His eyes darkened as he thrust the cool-box towards her .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mervyn did not answer but thrust the book towards him .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She thrust the customary tip towards the croupier with a slip of paper wrapped around a plaque .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She was carrying a small spear and only just had time to raise it and thrust it at the Scarag .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Prince did n&#39;t even wait for an answer but turned to a small table beside him , slopped two goblets full of wine , rose and thrust them at his unwanted guests .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She pushed back her slim shoulders beneath the red jacket she was wearing and thrust her chin at him defiantly .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tommy had thrust a bayonet right through its belly .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the little back parlour , a coal fire , rendered more fierce by the confines of the small , black-leaded grate , thrust yellow flames up the chimney .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He took off his jacket and tossed it across a wooden bench by the fire .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She tossed the letter across the table .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He tossed a glittering object through the air .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He tossed the packet towards her a few moments later .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He drew out a pack of five cigars and tossed them towards Moss .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He tossed the money towards the bed .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He sank back into his chair as Pyke and I walked away from the table , and tossed the whisky down his throat .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So he jumps down onto the walkway and upends the body , tossing it over the side .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He smiled , taking a last draw on the cigarette before tossing it over the rail .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You must turn your back , shut your eyes , and toss it over your shoulder . &#34;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It unrolled as he tugged it across the bedroom floor , and inside was the blood-soaked corpse of Maria Shill .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mr Yarrow tugged a long card-index box across the desk and set about it with a bespittled finger .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;` Do n&#39;t be silly ! &#34; snaps the woman , tugging her offspring through the throng .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Catching her hand , he began tugging her back towards the car .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She twined her fingers through Piers &#39;s and tugged him towards the door .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She yanked Anna toward the car and did n&#39;t stop even when the child stumbled and almost fell .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He put his hand in his jacket pocket , searching for his wallet , and as he did , Doug , serious now , yanked Harry towards him and whispered in tones from which all traces of his cockney accent were now absent .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She walked across the room and , grabbing her daughter &#39;s long hair , yanked her towards the cell door .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\"\n",
