clear polythene bag and filed it in Mrs Allen 's notes to allow regular reassessment of healing .</li><li>As a unique event , Karen could file it away in her snapshot album as one of the interesting things that had happened during her holiday in France .</li><li>` Oh , I keep everything at home -- I file them there , on my own system , \" said Mr Kronweiser eagerly .</li><li>Cranston and Athelstan stabled their horses in a dingy tavern and walked back , forcing their way through to the great prison door .</li><li>He said nothing , perched his executive case on a working surface , opened it , searched it swiftly .</li><li>Clearing his throat noisily , Price perched a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles on his nose and announced he had received a letter from India .</li><li>Still using the flashlight , he perched the case on his desk , took out his key ring , used the two keys which unlocked the specially reinforced bottom right-hand drawer .</li><li>We perched her vast behind on the back seat and rested , gasping .</li><li>She perched her cup on the edge of the table , thinking hard .</li><li>She stood up to get her little-black hat , perched it on the side of her sleek fair head and skewered a pearl-tipped hatpin through the felt .</li><li>She parked the car and hoisted the plastic carriers from the boot , perching the flat , be-ribboned p)sserie box on top .</li><li>I took the fedora from the hat peg and perched it over my brow .</li><li>She perched a pair of ivory-framed pincenez on to her sparrow 's beak of a nose and peered through them .</li><li>Their education certainly suffered as the teachers did not like them interrupting the curriculum and sat them at the back of the class and told them to write home .</li><li>Roy had sat Janine at the kitchen table and was standing beside her .</li><li>She tells me the ambulance is on its way , then she fetches Ma downstairs and sits her by the Rayburn .</li><li>When he saw the state the girl was in he sat her in an armchair and sent his adjutant to get her something to drink .</li><li>As Alan sat him in his cot and left the room , Christopher began to howl in earnest again , interrupted by spasms of coughing which left him breathless .</li><li>His face set grimly , he wrapped her in a warm , dry bathsheet , then sat her on a stool and sponged her face , smoothing the tangled curls from her pallid face .</li><li>When we were naughty he 'd give Fred the strap but he 'd sit me on the mantelpiece to make me mind my manners .</li><li>Then , after about five weeks , in desperation , I sat her on the toilet , and from then on she was clean .</li><li>Diana daubed luminous paint on the eyes of her cuddly green hippo so that at night it seemed as though he was keeping watch and looking after her .</li><li>Beside him on the counter were large dirty bottles of gilt glass from which he would take out the stoppers and daub them on the sleeves of passers-by .</li><li>` If you want , I could probably get Mum to meet you , \" said Josh , drizzling ketchup over his grilled chicken .</li><li>Schneider draped a sheet about his shoulders and reached for a pair of scissors .</li><li>They lay together for a while , half asleep , kissing now and again ; then she draped one leg across his hips and they began to make love languorously , without speaking .</li><li>He shrugged and draped a casual arm around Hari 's shoulder .</li><li>So she did n't sit down for a last five-minute chat , but let Ron drape her coat around her .</li><li>She gestured Melanie over to her and draped the material around her shoulders .</li><li>She shivered , and Adam draped an arm around her shoulders .</li><li>He draped the towel around his shoulders and shook his head .</li><li>Shirts and sheets they hung from the ceiling , draping them on lines and hangers .</li><li>Kate draped the shawl on the counter .</li><li>Still tied together with the strands of wool we moved towards the fence intending to drape it on the wire .</li><li>\" He took off his coat and draped it over Harry .</li><li>Singer draped the T-shirt over his head , but his laughter was evident in the way his shoulders shook .</li><li>He draped inflamable material over it and calibrated the switch to come on later in the day .</li><li>Jean-Pierre picked up a shawl and draped it over Jane 's shoulders .</li><li>They draped the starched white tablecloth over the big deal table .</li><li>You draped your best cummerbund over the lampshade ?</li><li>His eyes narrowed briefly , then he draped the jacket round her shoulders before leading the way to the stairs .</li><li>But Caliban would drape a tarpaulin round it .</li><li>She drapes this green scarf round my neck .</li><li>He draped tinsel round the pink lampshades on the table .</li><li>The others also draped their underclothes among the branches .</li><li>When they 'd finished washing Mina and Kāli draped their clean wet clothes among the hundreds of others stretched between the scraggy thorn trees .</li><li>She draped it at my neck and sprayed it with her perfume : it still smells faintly of Chanel .</li><li>Schools and most offices closed ; taxis flew black flags ; shops draped black banners from their windows ; convoys of lorries clogged roads towards the Chinese border .</li><li>Eager hands unrolled the garlands of tinsel and draped them round t ] he branches .</li><li>To add an even more damning touch , Zhukov had draped an airforce uniform over the edge of the bed , and superimposed Vologsky 's personal insignia upon it .</li><li>He took the sword out of Alexei 's hand and jabbed it into the planks at the bottom of the punt , then draped Alexei 's coat over it .</li><li>He pulled the blanket from underneath himself and draped it over his shoulders .</li><li>Doreen stepped out of her slip , and draped it over a chair .</li><li>He pulled the clothing out , draping them over the side of the chest .</li><li>She dabbed some perfume on her throat and ran downstairs .</li><li>As soon as he came in I made him let me look at his head , and I dabbed some Dettol on it .</li><li>Nevertheless , as I dab calamine on my spare tyres , I ca n't deny that this is n't my finest hour .</li><li>He winced as she dabbed disinfectant on the cut and covered it up for him .</li><li>She dabs a little powder on top , and stands back to admire the effect .</li><li>I mix some sap green with Prussian blue and burnt umber still left in the palette and dab it onto the previously dampened , shaded areas of the greenery .</li><li>I picked a fish-louse from it as it lay on the unhooking mat , dabbed a bit of waterproof ointment on a small wound on its flank , then slipped it back into the water .</li><li>She had dabbed powder over her lipstick to rob it of its bright crimson lustre , and she had forgotten the little pink patches of rouge that gave her cheeks their rosy healthy glow .</li><li>He put his head in his hands as the waiter brought over the glass of water ; he sipped it , and dabbed some on his temples to cool them .</li><li>I dabbed a little on each puckered mouth to further shouts of laughter and much dancing about the room .</li><li>When Zoser dabbed a little on his wife 's sleeve she took the sleeve and held it up to her nose .</li><li>Overcome with rage and frustration , Dora jammed a fist against her mouth and gnawed at her knuckles .</li><li>With a groan of defeat he slumped back against the reception desk , jamming his elbow against the counter .</li><li>She dried the udder and pulled the three-legged stool across , jamming the first bucket between her knees as she sat down , so that Florence could not kick it over .</li><li>He jammed a finger in each ear .</li><li>Hargreave dug out the stub of a cigar from his top pocket and examined it with distaste before jamming it in his mouth .</li><li>I jammed one finger in my ear against the fourth circle of hell that had just broken loose .</li><li>Chris attempts to clear his desk by jamming all outstanding items in the biggest , bottom drawer .</li><li>She laughed hysterically , jamming her fingers into her mouth to muffle the sound .</li><li>She jammed her fists into her pockets .</li><li>Claire jams the black box into her shoulder bag .</li><li>I smiled at her , and she jammed a copy of Pravda into my hand , her smile still ticking over .</li><li>Donald jammed the shotgun into the crook of bone under Nathan 's jaw .</li><li>He stopped , jammed his hands on his hips and leaned forward from the waist in a belligerent posture .</li><li>He jammed the one-eyed spectacles onto his face and fled .</li><li>The tyres screamed as he jammed his foot to the floor and the car shot into traffic .</li><li>He slid the ramrod out , jammed it down the long barrel , then pulled it free .</li><li>He put the cheese in the fridge and jammed a stool up against the door ; otherwise it would swing open , and everything would go bad .</li><li>A BLIND man fought off a bull terrier that attacked his guide dog -- by jamming his fist down its throat and smacking it between the eyes .</li><li>Clive spilled some of the powder as he heaped it in the spoon , and could not hold it steady over his lighter flame , but finally he got it liquefied .</li><li>I smiled at them , heaped more food on to their plates , poured more mint tea or coffee into their cups .</li><li>The larva heaps sand or soil onto its head and jaws and then flicks it with some force up and behind it , working in a circle to produce a conical pit .</li><li>She heaped a teaspoonful of instant coffee into a couple of beakers and poured a steaming jet of water on to it .</li><li>Sadly , unscrupulous ski resorts might misuse the new polymer , surreptitiously dusting it on the slopes of their rivals .</li><li>` My wife loves the man 's poems , \" said Crump , dusting the dead creature onto the ground .</li><li>Asked for a safety deposit box after she 'd seen me cramming Belgian banknotes in an envelope .</li><li>Darius grabs a wedge , ices it with half an inch of butter , crams it in his mouth and washes it down with a can of Coke .</li><li>At least you wo n't have to cram a printer in your briefcase as well as lug a portable over your shoulder .</li><li>David , aged nine , empties our bin in the yard to pick out

a strong flat base on a good floor -- not bouncy floorboards .</li><li>This means that sensors can often be mounted directly on the walls of metal reaction vessels and pipework .</li><li>The remaining pair of pads , mounted at the bottom of the tube , are used as fire buttons .</li><li>There are certain errors inherent with a Compass System mounted in an aircraft .</li><li>Over the mottled beige tiled mantel piece , with its brass jar filled with coloured spills , was a glass case of military cap badges mounted in wooden frames .</li><li>The slides were then air dried and mounted in glycerine jelly .</li><li>Ideally , every trailer should be anchored by the ball hitch on to a ball mounted in the ground .</li><li>These two values can usually be varied by controls mounted on the gyro itself or , in some cases , also changed at the transmitter .</li><li>The conduit system , where the power was drawn by a plough mounted under the car , from a centre slot between the rails , proved unreliable in Blackpool because of local conditions .</li><li>At Mycenae , too , is the famous Lion Gate , which shows the pillar mounted upon a Minoan-style altar and flanked by protecting lions .</li><li>The add-list can then be stapled to each batch of invoices for the accounting period as a permanent record and filed on a lever arch file for each contract .</li><li>Boards are simply nailed to a timber framework on the walls , positioned so that the edges and centres of each board are supported .</li><li>Thin strips of pine ½ × ½in are nailed and glued into the end panels for battens

immense butterfly impaled against the wood .</li><li>And not only were women put to the sword but the heads of those guilty of child murder were nailed above the gallows .</li><li>Only two feet above the glassy water a dozen dug-out canoes are lashed to the side and more join us all the time .</li><li>One of the most moving pictures printed in L'Illustration during the war was of one of these

on relatively late in production , in fact after the necks have been fitted to the bodies .</li><li>The slogan was spelled out in three-foot-high polystyrene lettering and glued onto a soft canvas backdrop .</li><li>Haphazardly placed photographs of King George and Queen Elizabeth , cut from a magazine , had been hastily glued to the wall before the landlord came to lunch -- to hide the marks

dining room wall .</li><li>We did find the Hall that was to be home for the next couple of nights , with a note pinned to the door giving directions to the pub where the rest of the Society had gathered .</li><li>Even today Auntie Jean was straight-backed and splendid in high heels and a dark-blue dress with a diamond brooch in the shape of a diving fish pinned to her front .</li><li>It was an all-male affair and each delegate wore a lettered , white disc pinned to his lapel which Wycliffe could not read .</li><li>There was a little blue brooch pinned to the neck of the dress .</li><li>The man was perhaps in his sixties , the empty right-hand sleeve of his jacket pinned to his side .</li><li>Once the coffin had received its primary lining and edged frill , two rectangular

collar .</li><li>A pair of hauling ropes is also fastened to the leading edge of each tank , one rope towards each end of the tank .</li><li>Although I was shackled to a radiator , my blindfold was removed and I was given a cup of water and a sweetmeat .</li><li>Settled in what had become his usual position , Hargreave watched and waited in the observation chamber as Wingate was led in and shackled to the heavy steel chair in the centre of the room .</li><li>Before opening the file he added his initials to the readership list gummed to the top right corner .</li><li>These receipts are gummed into a special book kept for the purpose , as they would have to be produced if a claim for compensation is made .</li><li>Of the many directives gummed to the glass partition , one took the trouble to thank me for not smoking .</li><li>The ends of the coil should be soldered to the termination strips to allow for the later attachment of heavier gauge connecting cable .</li><li>This had now been soldered to the main building so well that you could n't see the join .</li><li>The front panel carries the switches , and the timing resistors are soldered directly to the tags of the rotary switch S2 as shown in Fig. 3 .</li><li>Where the mains leads are soldered to the output socket SK1 the solder joints and tags should be covered with plastic sleeving .</li><li>Permanent taps were soldered into the telephone lines of selected individuals and organisations at intermediate distribution frames -- a place where civilian technicians were unlikely to discover them .</li><li>Finally , the lead depositum plate was soldered into place .</li><li>However , he again refused to wear his uniform and was forcibly dressed and handcuffed to the cell bars .</li><li>He was handcuffed to the North Shore .</li><li>He was handcuffed to another prisoner and placed in an army , armoured personnel carrier .</li><li>She was handcuffed to the bed .</li><li>Each of these , in turn , holds a Skeleton , with its arms manacled to the floor .</li><li>Three concrete blocks were cemented to the patio stones at the rear of the new pond as a base for this filter -- it was important that these were all at the same level .</li><li>They forced their way onto adjoining land and cut through chain-link fencing and large wooden posts cemented into the ground .</li><li>The best are those where the head is made from a single piece of metal rather than where individual teeth are riveted into place .</li><li>It was covered in lettering and had been riveted to the trousers , as if Grandson Richard was some sort of machine .</li><li>The hull was made of overlapping wrought-iron plates riveted to metal frames .</li><li>The calves , when only a few days old , are tethered by the neck in a stall about 60 cms wide and 150 cms long , until they are too large to turn .</li><li>The goats were tethered on a patch of grassy ground close to one of the gates .</li><li>` Lightweight dinghies should n't be used unless they are tethered to the shore , \" said Peter Race .</li><li>Horses to be sold in the market were always tethered to the iron railings along Ox Row , sheep being penned nearby , with cattle towards Blue Boar Row .</li><li>The rifles with which the Jews defended themselves have been welded onto the sides of the vehicles as a memorial .</li><li>It must have been either forged or welded to the cap or fitted hot and allowed to cool into position .</li><li>Boys as young as 13 sped through the town astride their ` Mad-Max \" cars : usually Toyotas with the roofs sawn off and large Browning machine guns welded onto the back .</li><li>Police say a stolen lorry which had four foot long spikes welded to the back was probably going to be used in a ram raid .</li><li>Tragically the rope tied around Mrs Love 's ankle slipped from her husband 's grasp and she fell to her death .</li><li>From the spot in the hedgerow where the four German soldiers had come from a white flag tied to a long piece of wood had suddenly appeared .</li><li>A rope had been thrown over a low beam in the room and tied to the top of the Bookman 's cage .</li><li>The raft was moored by the side of
