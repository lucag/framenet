task is made much more difficult by the fact that derogations granted to the Welsh water authority allow it to pump raw sewage into both those rivers .</li><li>The longer we continue to pump lead into the atmosphere , the more it will accumulate .</li><li>The Suffolk Water Company is pumping specially dechlorinated water into the habitat of the fen raft spider , Britain 's largest and rarest , to save it from extinction .</li><li>However , once the salt fingers are formed , they are pumping salty fluid into the top of the bottom layer and less salty fluid into the bottom of the top layer .</li><li>This has been open to doubt since June 8 , 1989 when an extreme left-wing group pumped 20 bullets into Valenzuela 's former chief , ` Wally \" Fuentes Morrison .</li><li>Carter toppled over

.</li><li>The following week tests were carried out and I went with Dad to watch the Brigade endeavouring to pump water to the roof of Blooms the Drapers on The Canal -- possibly the City 's tallest building .</li><li>One possibility being considered is for solar power to be used to pump downstream water back up to the main reservoir , so restoring the head of water needed to generate hydro-electric power .</li><li>A valuable way of concealing them is to have bars , stripes or blobs of colour that appear to overflow from one section to the next , as though someone has splashed ink

.</li><li>I splashed water over my face , slicked unruly grey hair into a more reasonable disorder , and headed down to the lobby again .</li><li>In fact , she thought as she splashed cold water on to her hot face , she had n't seen him all morning -- perhaps he 'd taken himself off for a walk .</li><li>He splashed some down the front of my tunic and was gone .</li><li>Eddie splashed more of the liquid against his temples , brushing it back and then rubbing it in with a comb .</li><li>I splashed more over my face .</li><li>Some female handed them a hypo-bulb and they sprayed it into Jezrael

.</li><li>When he saw us he choked and sprayed the beer onto the lawn .</li><li>He shook his head , spraying drops over the room , over his clothes discarded on the floor .</li><li>Mojo shook the thing fiercely , spraying ink over the station head .</li><li>Farmers in the region are not allowed to spray manure over the surface of their fields .</li><li>The combat unit had sprayed napalm or some napalm analogue into the Silver Shuriken , and he was clothed in fire .</li><li>Battling Dave Cannon sprayed a whole trailer-load of the cow muck over a council building after plans for his retirement bungalow were turned down for the fourth time .</li><li>Watching the Turks spray it around the park against our implacable foes , the English recently , the mystery deepened as to how we managed to knock in five goals against them at Lansdowne Road .</li><li>He crouched behind the mother to squirt milk into the bottle .</li><li>A handsome Irish youth with ginger hair squirted some boiling water into the teapot and swilled a cup of dark brown liquid into a chipped cup .</li><li>It is a superbly efficient food gatherer , and can siphon ten gallons of water at a single suck and squirt this into the elephant 's mouth .</li><li>For many of them , the classroom will be the first place where they are able to play with water and even spill it on the floor without incurring an
